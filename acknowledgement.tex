I want to express my deep gratitude to all those people without whom this project would never have been completed. I want to give special appreciation to my supervisor, Dr. Prolay Kr. Mal, to provide me with the opportunity to work in CMS with this exciting work. Also, I want to thank my supervisor for his enthusiasm, support, encouragement, and patience, which help me to complete this project.\\
Furthermore, I would like to express special gratitude to Prafulla Saha; without his assistance, this work remains incomplete. I also want to thank Alok Kumar Das, Amit Pal, Chandiprashad Kar, Kuldeep Kumar Pal, Lipsa Rani Panda, Priyanka Mishra, and Tribeni Mishra for their assistance and a healthy discussion over the doubts in the course of this project.

Pattanaik for making the humorous, light, and wonderful environment in the lab.\\ 
I would like to thank DAE(India) for providing me with financial support. I also like to express my gratitude to the NISER and SPS, where I learned to develop a research career.\\
I also want to thank my mother, family, and friends for their patience and sacrifices during all this time.
