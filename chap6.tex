\chapter{\label{summary}Summary and Conclusion}
In this study, we saw how we can use machine learning techniques(Deep Neural Network)  to classify data from CMS, CERN as the signal events from the backgrounds. We mainly focused on simulated Monte Carlo data samples produced after PP collision at the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 13TeV at the integrated luminosity of 137 $fb^{-1}$. A few of the samples produced are Tprime $T'$, Standard model Higgs(SMH), and the Non-Resonant backgrounds(NRB) are used for the analysis. The DNN model training has been done for three different ranges of mass points of $T'$([600,700]$\cup$[800, 1000]$\cup$ [1100, 1200]) as the signals while the SMH as the the backgrounds for the better sensitivity of the DNN model. The advantages of using deep neural networks (DNN) for training  as it updates all the parameters itself to give a better optimized outputs by updating its weights using back propagation methods after each iteration or the epochs.

The cross-section of signals are smaller compared with the background processes with having larger cross section. In the machine learning training, model separation of signals and backgrounds seems to be getting better with increasing mass of the $T'$.  The DNN training output score used to tests over the different datasets and plotted as the stacked ratio plot. To scale the data and the Monte Carlo, the Monte Carlo samples have been scaled with output from the linear fit of the ration plot.  

In this blinded analysis with 115 < $m_{\gamma\gamma}< 135$GeV, with the cuts applied to separate signal events from the backgrounds and further scaling the NRB backgrounds with scaling parameters, all the Monte Carlo were rescaled. Using Higgs Combined Tools under CMMSW environment, the expected limit for the each mass point of the heavy resonance particle $T'$ have been calculated. 

 The output of the DNN model have been compared with another existing public analysis on the Run II data at 137$fb^{-1}$ using Boosted Decision Trees(BDT). In comparison, the DNN seems to have better sensitivity in the higher mass ranges.

% searched for single produced vector-like T quarks decaying at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. Here, an analysis to look for $T{^'} \longrightarrow$ top + H with H$\longrightarrow \gamma \gamma$. This analysis is composed on leptonic channel only and is based on DNNs to seperate the signal $T^'$ from the major backgrounds. Expected limits have been calculated for the DNN output variables. The predicted limit output from the DNN, compared with the expected limits of the another machine learning techniques, BDT, 

By the end of 2025, LHC is supposed to be upgraded to high luminosity LHC(HL-LHC) which is supposed to have collected data with an integrated luminosity of 3000 $fb^{-1}$. With the higher luminosity, a new analysis can be performed using sophisticated machine learning techniques to have more signal significance. With more data, we hope to discover some exciting new physics!
